# micepod-podextractr
This repository consists of the source code for podextractr, a command line tool in python used to extract data from Micepods.

### Demo
Since the demostration of the extraction would require a funcational micepod, a demo dummy app has been included in order to mimic how the process would have looked like without a funcational micepod.

### Setup
``` bash
sh setup.sh
```

### Launch
``` bash
# for deployment
sh launch.sh

# for demo
sh launch.sh demo
```
